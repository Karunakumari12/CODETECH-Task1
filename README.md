**Overview of the Basic Calculator Project**

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a simple, interactive calculator program in Python. The calculator will allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features**
User Input: The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Operation Selection: The user will be able to select an operation from the following:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Result Display: The program will perform the selected operation on the two numbers and display the result to the user.
Error Handling: The program will handle division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message.
**Components**
**1)Input Handling:**

The program will use the input() function to receive numbers and operation choice from the user.
Input validation is minimal, assuming users will input numbers correctly.
**2)Operations:**

Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
Control Flow:

The program uses if-elif-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on user input.
The result is calculated and printed to the console.
Error Handling:

Division by zero is handled by checking if the second number is zero before performing the division.
**3)Implementation:**
The program consists of a single function, calculator(), which encapsulates all the functionality:

Step 1: Prompt the user to enter the first number.
Step 2: Prompt the user to enter the second number.
Step 3: Display the available operations and prompt the user to choose one.
Step 4: Perform the chosen operation and display the result.
Step 5: Handle division by zero by checking if the denominator is zero and displaying an error message if it is.
**4)Example Usage:**
